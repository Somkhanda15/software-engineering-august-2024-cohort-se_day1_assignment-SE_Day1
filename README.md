#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. It is important because it reduces complexity of projects, makes it easier when dealing with big data projects, it minimizes software costs and it is more effective.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The development of programming languages- Fortran is an example dveloped in the the 1950s for scientific and engineering calculations.
-The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s which encompasses concerpts,theories,principles,techniques and tools that can be used for developing high-quality proffesional softwares.
-The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s, Agile methodology is an iterative and collaborative project management and software development approach. It is based on the principles which prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Itâ€™s ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and low likelihood of changes, such as in regulatory environments or when developing mission-critical systems.
- Agile is iterative and incremental, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration. It involves continuous feedback and allows for changes throughout the development process. Agile suits projects with evolving requirements or when rapid delivery is crucial, like in startup environments or when developing consumer-facing applications.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-  -Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g virtual studio and Pycharm.
 - Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Managing Project Requirements- Requirements can be unclear or change frequently. This can be managed by implementing Agile methodologies to adapt to changes through iterative development and regular feedback.
-Ensuring Code Quality-Maintaining high-quality, bug-free code is difficult thus  adopting practices like code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration (CI). Follow coding standards and use static analysis tools to catch issues early.
-Technical Debt-Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.Regularly refactor code and address technical debt during sprints. Allocate time for debt reduction and prioritize it alongside new feature development.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.It catches bugs at the earliest stage, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
-Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. It Identifies problems with data flow and interaction between modules.
-Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.It confirms that the software fulfills user needs and expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively interact with AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. It involves crafting prompts that elicit accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI by carefully structuring the input to align with the model's capabilities and understanding.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt- "Tell me about the environment."
Improved Prompt
"Describe the key impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, including effects on wildlife and vegetation."

The original prompt is too broad and lacks focus. It doesn't specify what aspect of the environment is of interest or what kind of information is needed. This revised prompt is clear and specific. It narrows down the topic to climate change and its effects on coastal ecosystems, specifying the need to include impacts on wildlife and vegetation. This helps the AI provide a more targeted and relevant response.
